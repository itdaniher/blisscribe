Go to demo.py to see how to create a new BlissTranslator and translate text with it.

Run the demo if you want to see a default example.  Otherwise, comment out the demo and write your own code.

If you have large amounts of text to translate, feel free to add them to excerpts.py and access them through the excerpts module in the demo.
