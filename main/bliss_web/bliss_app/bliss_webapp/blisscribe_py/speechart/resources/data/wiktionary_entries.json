     "(heading) As a modal verb, the subjunctive of will . Used to give a conditional or potential \"softening\" to the present; might, might wish . [from 9 c.] Used as the auxiliary of the simple conditional modality (with a bare infinitive); indicating an action or state that is conditional on another. [from 9 th c.] 2010, The Guardian, 26 February: Warnock admitted it would be the ideal scenario if he received a Carling Cup winners' medal as well as an England call-up [ \u2026 ] . (chiefly archaic) Might wish (+ verb in past subjunctive); often used in the first person (with or without that) in the sense of \" if only \". [from 13 th c.] 1859, John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, I presently wished, would that I had been in their clothes! would that I had been born Peter! would that I had been born John! 1868, Sir Walter Scott, Ivanhoe, Ch.23: I would she had retained her original haughtiness of disposition, or that I had a larger share of Front-de-B\u0153uf's thrice-tempered hardness of heart! 1912, Philostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana, translated by F. C. Conybeare (Loeb Classical Library), 8.16: But as the youth increased their annoyance by declaring that the goddess was quite right, because the Emperor was Archon Eponym of the city of Athens, he said: \" Would that he also presided the Panathenaic festival.\" Used to impart a sense of hesitancy or uncertainty to the present; might be inclined to. Now sometimes colloquially with ironic effect. [from 15 th c.] 2009, Nick Snow, The Rocket's Trail, p.112: \u201cThose trials are being run by the American army so surely you must have access to the documents?\u201d \u201cWell, yeah, you \u2019d think.\u201d 2010, Terry Pratchett, \"My case for a euthanasia tribunal\", The Guardian, 2 February: Departing on schedule with the help of a friendly doctor was quite usual. Does that still apply? It would seem so. Used interrogatively to express a polite request; are (you) willing to \u2026? [from 15 th c.] Would you pass the salt, please? (chiefly archaic, transitive or control verb) Might desire ; wish (something). [from 15 th c.] 1608, William Shakespeare, King Lear, I.4: What dost thou professe ? What would\u2019st thou with vs?",
