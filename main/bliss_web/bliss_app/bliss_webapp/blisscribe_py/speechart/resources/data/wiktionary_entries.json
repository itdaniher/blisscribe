Life seems a joke, a cruel, grim joke. You are a laughable incident or a terrifying one as you happen to be less powerful or more powerful than some other form of life which crosses your path; but as a rule you are of no moment whatsoever to anything but yourself. You are a comic little figure, hopping from the cradle to the grave. Yes, that is our trouble\u2014we take ourselves too seriously; but Caprona should be a sure cure for that.\" She paused and laughed. 1994, Violet Quill, Robert Ferro: Most things in life, including life itself, seemed to have articulated sections, discrete and separate and straightforward.

They were plainly intended to have a bracing moral effect, and perhaps had this result for the people at whom they were aimed. They left me with the impression of a well-delivered stereopticon lecture, with characters about as life -like as the shadows on the screen, and whisking on and off, at the mercy of the operator.
