# FrequencyWords
Repository for Frequency Word List Generator and processed files

In early days I hosted the generated files on OneDrive with my blog https://invokeit.wordpress.com/frequency-word-lists/ linking to it.
Moving forward, the code and the generated outputs are on GitHub.

### OpenSubtitle tokenized source
The data used to generate this lists can be found at http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/OpenSubtitles2016.php 

### Format of the frequency lists:
word1 number1 (number1 represents occurance of word1 across all files)

word2 number2 (number2 represents occurance of word2 across all files)
