Go to demo.py to see how to create a new BlissTranslator and translate text with it.

Go to the demo if you want to see default examples.  Comment out a desired example and run demo.py to see the translation in the out folder.  Otherwise, feel free to make use of the sample texts in the excerpts module.  If you want to translate a longer text, feel free to add it as a local .txt file and test translating it through demo.py.
